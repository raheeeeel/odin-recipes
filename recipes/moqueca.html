    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Moqueca is a traditional Brazilian seafood stew that originates from the coastal regions of Bahia and Espirito Santo. Rich, aromatic, and deeply flavorful, it typically features white fish or shellfish simmered gently in a broth of coconut milk, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and bell peppers. The dish is uniquely seasoned with ingredients like cilantro and dende oil (palm oil), which gives the Bahian version its vibrant color and distinctive earthy flavor. The Espirito Santo variant, known as moqueca capixaba, omits the coconut milk and dende oil, relying instead on annatto oil (urucum) for color and flavor, giving it a lighter and more herbal profile.</p> 

    <p>Traditionally cooked in clay pots that help retain heat and deepen flavor, moqueca is more than just a meal—it is a cultural experience. It is often served with rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour), and pirau, a savory porridge made from the stew’s broth and manioc flour. The dish reflects the Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous culinary influences that shape much of Brazilian cuisine, offering a balance of freshness, warmth, and complexity. Whether prepared in a home kitchen or savored at a seaside restaurant, moqueca embodies the soul of Brazil’s coastal food traditions.</p>
