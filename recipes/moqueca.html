    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Moqueca is a traditional Brazilian seafood stew that originates from the coastal regions of Bahia and Espirito Santo. Rich, aromatic, and deeply flavorful, it typically features white fish or shellfish simmered gently in a broth of coconut milk, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and bell peppers. The dish is uniquely seasoned with ingredients like cilantro and dende oil (palm oil), which gives the Bahian version its vibrant color and distinctive earthy flavor. The Espirito Santo variant, known as moqueca capixaba, omits the coconut milk and dende oil, relying instead on annatto oil (urucum) for color and flavor, giving it a lighter and more herbal profile.</p> 

    <p>Traditionally cooked in clay pots that help retain heat and deepen flavor, moqueca is more than just a meal—it is a cultural experience. It is often served with rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour), and pirau, a savory porridge made from the stew’s broth and manioc flour. The dish reflects the Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous culinary influences that shape much of Brazilian cuisine, offering a balance of freshness, warmth, and complexity. Whether prepared in a home kitchen or savored at a seaside restaurant, moqueca embodies the soul of Brazil’s coastal food traditions.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and pat dry the fish and cut into 2 inch peices. Place in a bowl. Add salt, zest from half the lime and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Massage lightly to coat all pieces well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add onion and salt, and sauté 2-3 minutes. Turn heat down to medium, add carrot, bell pepper, garlic and jalapeno and cook 4-5 more minutes. Add tomato paste, spices and stock. Mix and bring to a simmer and add tomatoes. Cover and simmer gently on medium low for 5 mintues or until carrots are tender.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and taste and add more salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Nestle the fish in the stew and simmer gently until it’s cooked through, about 4-6 minutes.  Spoon the flavorful coconut broth over the fish and cook until desired doneness or longer for thicker pieces. ( You can also finish this in a 350F oven).</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt and squeeze with lime.</li>
        <li>To serve, serve over rice, sprinkle with cilantro or scallions and a squeeze of lime.</li>
